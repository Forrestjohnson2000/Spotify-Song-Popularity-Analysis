**Introduction**
Analysis of Spotify top 200 charted songs to determine main factors that affect popularity and chart position

**Objective**
The purpose of this analysis is to find intriguing insights into the ranking of songs on the Spotify platform.  This analysis will seek to determine the ranking of a song on the weekly charts based on the data attributes of that song. In order, to predict these values, machine learning algorithms will be applied to the Kaggle dataset provided. With this, we will determine with a degree of accuracy the streams of a song based on its attributes. The analysis conducted in this will provide insights into understanding the relationship between recorded features of a song and its ranking in the Spotify top 200 charts. The value of this analysis will provide creators on the Spotify platform with a better understanding of the dynamics that propel certain material to the top of the Spotify charts and aggregate more streams.
